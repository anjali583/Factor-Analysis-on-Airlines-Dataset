To perform factor analysis on an airline dataset, let's consider the typical steps involved:

Understanding the Dataset: The first step is to understand the dataset. This includes knowing the variables available, their types, and any relevant descriptions. For an airline dataset, variables could include customer satisfaction scores, flight punctuality, in-flight service quality, ticket prices, etc.

Data Preparation:

Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
Standardization: Standardize the data, especially if variables are on different scales.
Choosing the Number of Factors: Use methods like the Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues > 1) and scree plot to decide the number of factors to retain.

Extracting Factors:

Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to extract factors.
Rotating Factors: Apply rotation (varimax, oblimin, etc.) to make the output more interpretable. Rotation does not affect the underlying data structure but makes it easier to understand which variables are associated with which factors.

Interpreting the Factors: Examine the factor loadings to understand what each factor represents. Factor loadings indicate the correlation between original variables and the factors.

Validation: Validate the factor model using various methods like factor scores or by applying the model to a different dataset.

Letâ€™s go through a hypothetical example using a simplified airline dataset with the following variables:

Customer Satisfaction (CS)
Flight Punctuality (FP)
In-flight Service Quality (ISQ)
Ticket Prices (TP)
Baggage Handling (BH)
Check-in Process (CIP)
Boarding Process (BP)
Step-by-Step Factor Analysis
Understanding and Preparing the Dataset:

Assume our dataset airline_data is already cleaned and standardized.
Choosing the Number of Factors:

Conduct PCA and look at the eigenvalues and scree plot to decide on the number of factors.
Extracting Factors:

Perform PCA or MLE on the dataset.
Rotating Factors:

Apply varimax rotation to the factors extracted.
Interpreting the Factors:

Analyze the rotated factor loadings to understand the relationships.
